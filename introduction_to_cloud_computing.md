## Notes

NIST defines Cloud computing as a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction

 This Cloud model is composed of:
 * five essential characteristics =  on-demand self service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service
 * four deployment models and
 * three service models.
